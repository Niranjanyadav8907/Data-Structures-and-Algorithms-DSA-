# DSA Problem Solutions üöÄ

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** repository! This is where I document my journey of solving various DSA problems, with a particular focus on **arrays** and **strings**, which are foundational topics for problem-solving and coding interviews.

## üîç Overview

This repository contains:

- **Solved Problems**: Solutions to DSA problems from various platforms (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank).
- **Topics Covered**: 
  - Arrays
  - Strings
  - Other common DSA topics (as I progress).
- **Optimized Solutions**: Focused on efficiency and readability, written primarily in **Java**.
